Please make a CRUD(create, read, update, delete) for users.
1. Create model, migration, factory and seeder for user entity (id, name, phone, email, photo, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at).
2. Implement Restful API controller for model User (We should have validation at least for update method) .
3. Add an ability to send sms for each newly created user (We are going to have several sms providers and select active in config).
4. For each removed user we want to send sms and email notification. (Keep in mind for this we use external api services and it does not have fixed response time).
